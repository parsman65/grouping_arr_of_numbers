# grouping_arr_of_numbers
in this simple javaScript code I want to grouping numbers side by side in array of numbers
for example we have an array such --> let arr = [5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 17, 20, 21, 22];
and the res is -- > resultArray = [ [5, 6] , [9, 10, 11], [17], [20, 21, 22];

the numbers that are side by side are grouping in separated arrays
